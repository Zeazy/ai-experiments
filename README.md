# FastAI Course Repository

This repository is primarily to document my journey to learn more about AI. It will include AI experiments and learnings from tutorials, videos and things that I read.
The main hope is that it'll help keep my accountable as I balance it with life. If it proves useful to someone one day, that's a bonus. Let's go!
